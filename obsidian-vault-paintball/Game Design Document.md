# What does this game aim to be?

This game is a movement-based boomer shooter, with maps based on [UNICAMP's](https://unicamp.br/) spaces. The goal of the project is to be a showcase project.

> As it would be probably seen as in bad taste to show gory/blood-filled game in university events, the family friendly idea was to make a paintball based game.
